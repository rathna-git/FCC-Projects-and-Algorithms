        <h3>Here's a brief time line of Dr. Hawking's life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1942</strong> - Born in Oxford, England to Frank and Isobel Hawking.</li>
        <li><strong>1950</strong> - Family moves to St Albans, Hertfordshire. He attends St Albans school.</li>
        <li><strong>1959</strong> - Gets rewarded  scholarship at Oxford University and he finishes his undergraduate studies in just 4 years.</li>
        <li><strong>1962</strong> - Begins his Graduate work at Trinity College, Cambridge</li>
        <li><strong>1965</strong> - Married Jane Wilde, whom he had met shortly before his diagnosis with motor neurone disease, continued to develop.</li>
        <li><strong>1966</strong> - Obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology, in March 1966; and his essay titled "Singularities and the Geometry of Space-Time" shared top honours with one by Penrose to win that year's prestigious Adams Prize.</li> 
        <li><strong>1970</strong> - Hawkings and Penrose, published a proof that if the universe obeys the general theory of relativity and fits any of the models of physical cosmology developed by Alexander Friedmann, then it must have begun as a singularity. With James M. Bardeen and Brandon Carter, he proposed the four laws of black hole mechanics, drawing an analogy with thermodynamics.</li>
        <li><strong>1973</strong> - Hawking's first book, The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time, written with George Ellis, was published. </li> 
        <li><strong>1975</strong> - Moves back to Cambridge to a more academically senior post, as reader in gravitational physics. He was awarded both the Eddington Medal and the Pius XI Gold Medal.</li>
        <li><strong>1979</strong> - Hawking's speech deteriorated, and by the late 1970s he could be understood by only his family and closest friends. To communicate with others, someone who knew him well would translate his speech into intelligible speech.</li>
        <li><strong>1982</strong> -  Hawking and Gary Gibbons organised a three-week Nuffield Workshop on "The Very Early Universe" at Cambridge University, which focused mainly on inflation theory. Hawking also began a new line of quantum theory research into the origin of the universe.</li>
        <li><strong>1984</strong> - Completed first draft of the book, called <em>A Brief History of Time</em>. It is a popular-science book on cosmology.e discusses two major theories, general relativity and quantum mechanics, that modern scientists use to describe the universe. Sold over 9 million copies.</li>
        <li><strong>1985</strong> - Hawking contracted pneumonia, which in his condition was life-threatening; he was so ill that Jane was asked if life support should be terminated. She refused, but the consequence was a tracheotomy, which would require round-the-clock nursing care and remove what remained of his speech.</li>
        <li><strong>1988</strong> - Received prestigious Wolf Prize.</li>
        <li><strong>1993</strong> - Hawking pursued his work in physics: he co-edited a book on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary Gibbons and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang.</li>
        <li><strong>1995</strong> - Divorces Jane Hawking and married Mason in September.</li>
        <li><strong>1997</strong> - Six-part television series Stephen Hawking's Universe and a companion book appeared.</li>
        <li><strong>2002</strong> - UK-wide vote, the BBC included Hawking in their list of the 100 Greatest Britons.</li>
        <li><strong>2005</strong> - Hawking gradually lost the use of his hand, and  he began to control his communication device with movements of his cheek muscles, with a rate of about one word per minute.</li>
        <li><strong>2009</strong> - Receives Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is America's highest civilian honor.</li>
        <li><strong>2015</strong> - Hawking said that not all information is lost when something enters a black hole and there might be a possibility to retrieve information from a black hole according to his theory.</li>
        <li><strong>2017</strong> - Received  Honorary Doctorate from Imperial College London.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <blockquote>"I have noticed that even people who claim everything is predetermined and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road."
